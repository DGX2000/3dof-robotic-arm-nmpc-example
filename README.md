# NMPC for a 3-DOF Robotic Arm
Example for controlling a 3-DOF robotic arm with an NMPC utilizing IPOPT for optimization.

## Roadmap
### Development
- [ ] Set up SFML project
- [ ] Set up OpenGL
- [ ] Set up controls for moving
- [ ] Set up controls for moving the target point

### Control engineering
- [ ] Forward kinematics
- [ ] Inverse kinematics
- [ ] Motion equations (Lagrangian, Hamiltonian?)
- [ ] Integrator (symplectic?)
- [ ] Integrate IPOPT for optimization
- [ ] Integrate eigen for calculation (is it needed?)
- [ ] Formulate NMPC
- [ ] Parallelization?
