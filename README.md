# NMPC for a 3-DOF Robotic Arm
Example for controlling a 3-DOF robotic arm with an NMPC utilizing IPOPT for optimization.

## Roadmap
### Development
- [X] Set up SFML project
- [X] Set up OpenGL
- [X] Set up scene graph
- [ ] Set up controls for moving camera (move along a sphere around robotic arm)
- [ ] Meshes for cylinders, spheres
- [ ] Render robotic arm
- [ ] Set up controls for moving the target point

### Control engineering
- [ ] Forward kinematics
- [ ] Inverse kinematics
- [ ] Motion equations (Lagrangian, Hamiltonian?)
- [ ] Integrator (symplectic?)
- [ ] Integrate IPOPT for optimization
- [ ] Integrate eigen for calculation (is it needed?)
- [ ] Formulate and implement NMPC
